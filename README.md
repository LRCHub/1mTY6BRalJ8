```lrc
[00:17.73] In the dusty basement where we met
[00:23.00] May you surprised so much
[00:27.33] Because you're talking now
[00:32.80] I gotta find the truth from many fights
[00:37.82] But I'm alone, you're the only one who can help me out
[00:43.63] We'll be as one
[00:47.94] We're ready to fight, look over there
[00:51.94] They try to kill us for stars
[00:55.91] Our bond has got much stronger than before
[01:16.91] 
[01:02.96] Don't lose your way in your mind
[01:07.18] We have to be as one
[01:10.96] Don't be afraid my sweetheart
[01:15.49] This is the way to be more strong
[01:19.47] Harbor my deep secret, makes me so blue
[01:27.15] Run through this game before my body is dry
[01:48.65] 
[01:52.08] So it seems there's no other choice but to go all out
[01:54.74] Stay with me and let's stand out
[01:56.72] And outshine those trying to get our stars now
[01:59.42] All we have to do is figure out how strong we are
[02:02.48] And what it takes to stay alive
[02:04.27] Sync and learn what we can do to take 'em down
[02:07.14] It's revenge and survive
[02:19.14] 
[02:08.26] For now, we know in part
[02:10.16] And you can feel my heart
[02:12.04] So help me to stay focused so I don't fall apart
[02:16.11] I wanna be complete, it's not in me to retreat
[02:20.16] I could lose on my own so I really need you with me
[02:45.66] 
[02:24.61] I gotta find out who killed my dad
[02:28.67] I hear the voice of you in my mind
[02:32.63] I gotta find out who killed my dad
[02:36.68] I hear the voice of you in my mind so
[02:55.18] 
[02:43.21] My blood is pumping
[02:44.84] I'm ready to fight when you are
[02:47.02] Let's let no one break the bond that is ours
[02:51.01] Show them what it means to be a shining star
[02:54.16] You have my body
[02:56.16] Let's fight as one
[03:05.16] 
[02:57.45] Can't move my feet in the dark, don't wanna be all alone
[03:04.81] Can't feel the heat in my blood
[03:09.47] Do you remember what he said?
[03:23.97] 
[03:12.82] Don't lose your way in your mind (I really need you with me)
[03:16.99] We have to be as one (help me to stay focused)
[03:20.93] Don't be afraid my sweetheart (I wanna be complete)
[03:25.42] This is the way to be more strong (fight as one with me)
[03:29.57] Harbor my deep secret, it makes me so blue (let's take 'em down)
[03:36.09] (Be a shining star) run through this game before my body is dry
[04:07.59] 
[03:43.50] You have my body
[03:44.91] I'm ready to fight when you are
